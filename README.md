#DESCRIPTION
This project is a front-end E-Learning Platform User Interface (UI) created using only HTML5 and CSS3. The goal of the project was to design a clean, professional, and interactive multi-page interface that mimics the user experience of modern online learning platforms. It focuses solely on the design and layout aspect of an educational web application, laying the foundation for a fully functional e-learning product in the future.

The entire UI was developed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). VS Code’s user-friendly interface, built-in terminal, live preview capabilities, and extensions for HTML and CSS made the design process efficient and well-organized. The file structure is clean and modular, with separate files for each page and a single CSS file managing the styling across the platform.

The design includes multiple essential pages and UI components commonly found in real-world e-learning systems. These pages include:

Home Page: Features a professional banner, navigation bar, featured courses section, and call-to-action buttons. It serves as the main landing page for users to explore offerings.

Course Listing Page: Displays available courses in a card-based grid layout with course names, thumbnails, durations, and progress indicators. The layout is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes using Flexbox and media queries.

Course Detail Page (UI): Provides a placeholder layout for embedded video players, course description, module list, and progress bar. It was designed to resemble a real learning environment, allowing space for future JavaScript or backend integrations.

Progress Tracking Section: Includes styled progress bars and placeholders to show a learner’s progress through various lessons or modules. While the functionality is not implemented, the design simulates what a dynamic dashboard could look like.

Login/Signup UI Pages: Clean and minimal authentication form designs with proper structure, input fields, and buttons. These forms are visually centered and mobile-friendly.

Contact and About Pages: Designed to build trust and provide learners with a way to connect or understand the platform's mission.

For styling, I used CSS3 to craft a modern and cohesive theme across the platform. Key CSS techniques used include:

Flexbox and Grid for responsive layout design

Custom buttons with hover effects

Navigation bar with active state highlighting

Typography and spacing to maintain visual hierarchy and readability

Responsive media queries to ensure compatibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

No CSS frameworks or libraries were used in this project. All components, from the layout grid to the buttons and responsive cards, were handcrafted using raw CSS, showcasing my understanding of core design principles without relying on pre-built tools.

The site design focuses on user experience and usability, with an intuitive navigation system and clean structure. The simplicity of the UI allows for easy customization and future integration of dynamic behavior using JavaScript or server-side logic.

Throughout the development process, Git was used for version control. Meaningful commit messages were maintained to log every design iteration, layout update, and responsiveness enhancement. The project structure is scalable, and future enhancements like video playback functionality, user dashboard logic, or integration with back-end services can be built on top of this UI design.

In conclusion, this e-learning platform UI is a visual prototype of an educational web app. It demonstrates my front-end skills in HTML and CSS, design sense, and understanding of user interface layout and structure. The project highlights my ability to build professional, scalable, and visually consistent UI experiences without relying on libraries or frameworks.
